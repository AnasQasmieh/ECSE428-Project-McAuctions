Feature : Filter Items By Category

As a User
I want to be able to search items by category
So that i can find items I am looking for more easily

Scenario : A user filters items by category

	Given I am on the home page
	 When I select one of the categories in the top bar
	 Then the postings I see should see should be limited to that category
